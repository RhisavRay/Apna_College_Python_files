# ------------------------------------------------------------------ Variables in Python
# name = "Rhisav"
# age = 23

# print("My name is : " + name)
# print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
# The str(age) is needed as python can't concatenate str to str

# print("I am", age, "years old.")
# The same thing works when we use comma to separate them


# ------------------------------------------------------------------ Data types in Python
# name = "Rhisav"
# age = 23
# price = 16.34
# old = False
# a = None

# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))
# print(type(price))
# print(type(old))
# print(type(a))

# There are 5 data types in Python
# 1. Integer: +ve, -ve, zero
# 2. String: Anything between '', "", or even ''''''. But preferably use "" as that's the common rule of thumb used
# 3. Float: Decimal numbers
# 4. Boolean: True or False. Here the T and F HAVE to be in capital
# 5. None: This is used to represent the absence of a value or a null object reference
